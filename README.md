# ProGrad Project-Builder | JS | MOVIE MANIA

We have learned all the important concepts in JavaScript. Now lets work with our mini project builder in building a movie app, applying all of the concepts we have just learned.

## What should you do
```
Fork this repo
Clone this repo
Practice Axios, API, HTML and DOM Features
```

## How To Submit
```
Upon completion, run the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "ProGrad ID"

And finally, create a pull request so your ProGrad Mentor (PM) can review your work.
```

### Progression 1: GENERATE THE API KEY
Create an account in (https://www.themoviedb.org/). Once you create an account, go to settings and get your API key.

### Progression 2: POPULAR MOVIES IN ENGLISH
Use Axios for Fetch to fetch the data from https://www.themoviedb.org/ and display it as shown in the output.
